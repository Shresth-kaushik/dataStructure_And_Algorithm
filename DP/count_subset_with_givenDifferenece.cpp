// ONLY we write the finction for that .. 

// TWO REASONS FOR NOT GETTING ACCEPTED:

// 1)  We are initialising first column to 1, assuming there is only 1 way to make subset sum equal to 0,  i.e. null subset, BUT this fails if we have 0's as elements of array. If we have a single 0 present in the array, then the subsets will be '{}, {0}' whose sum will be 0. Hence, there can be more than 1 way to make sum==0.
// FIX: Don't initialise the first col to be 1. Everything will be initialized to 0 except the first cell in the table i.e. dp[0][0]=1. AND j will start from 0 instead of 1.
// 2)  In the derived formula, target = (diff+totalSum) / 2, NOTICE that (diff+totalSum) must be even for target to be a whole number, else it's not possible to find a decimal target in subset sum. Hence, we also need to take care of the test cases where it's not possible to partition the array.
// FIX: Check, if it's odd,  there is no way --> if((diff+totalSum)%2 != 0) return 0;
